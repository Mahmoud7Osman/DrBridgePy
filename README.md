# CVenom (Version 2.0 - Remastered)
<h3>CVenom, Malicious Codeblocks Central For Malware Developers</h3>

<h2>About a Year Ago, I Started Developing CVenom As a Malware Development Framework To Automate And Facilate Native Malware Development, Automating Things Such as Bypassing, Crashing And Confusing Antiviruses, Escalating Privileges And Gaining More Access, Injecting Startup Config Files Such as MS Windows Registry For Windows Systems And /etc/rcX.d For Linux, Deleting Logs, Accessing Hardwares Such As Keyboard To Create Keyloggers, USB Ports to Check, Infect Or Self-Spread USB Devices, Hard Disks To Initiate a Ransomeware Attack, Connecting To The Attacker Securely, Self-Destroy Capability, Compilation-Based Multiform Malware And So On......</h2>
<h2>But Unfortunately And Due To Legal Issues, I Killed CVenom And Everything Related to it (It Was Version 1.3 The Last Time I Added Some Evasion Functions To Calculate The Risk Of Detection).</h2>

<h2>And That's Why I Did That:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>I Remember That Day When I Developed a Virus Using My Framework CVenom (Named NMP Which Stands For No More PC, It Simply Spread itself in Connected Storage Devices And Infect Windows' Registry To Restart The Computer Everytime it Starts, in other words, A DOS Attack) To Spread it on Windows Machines, By Mistake, I Sent The Virus To My Uncle, And He is A Bank Employee, He Ran The EXE File, And His Windows PC Became Useless, It's Now My Turn To Fix His Machine, But What Happened is Unrealistic, I Can't Stop The Virus, I Can't Even Delete it From An External Live Booted Linux, The Disk Cannot Be Mounted As Read-Write, And That's After 3-4 Hours Of Locating the virus, it took me 2 days to delete the virus from his PC, 2 Days Of Working And I Am The Developer of The Virus!...., But There are 0 Antiviruses on VirusTotal Which Detected This Virus, Zero!</li>
  <li>I Developed A Keylogger, Named CRAN, I Remember I Realased 2 Versions, One For Windows And The Other For Linux, The Keylogger Works Offline And Online, Save And Encrypt Keystrokes Offline , Stream Encrypted Keystrokes Online (Live Keypresses), Move The Executable From HDD To RAM And Vise Versa When The User is Initiating a Shutdown, I Also Created A Web-Based Interface For Attackers To Control Their Victims, With An Excellent Evasion Functionnality Which Checks if There's A Plugged Storage Device That Contains This File "/cran.selfdestroy" As An Offline Hardware-Based Self-Destroy Signal, I Installed This Keylogger Legally on my Friend's PC, And Told him To Keep It And I Will Send a Self-Destroy Signal After 2 Days, And It Worked I Was Watching A Live Stream Of Keystrokes For 2 Days, Connecting and Disconnecting, Receiving Offline Encrypted Keystrokes, I Asked Myself If I Did That Illegally What Will Happen? I Don't Know But Zero Antivirus on Virus Total Flagged This Malware As Dangerous, It's a Bit Scary Right!?</li>
  <li>Every Malware I Developed Using CVenom,Is Being Detected By 0 Antiviruses On VirusTotal, Including Microsoft Defender For Windows, AVs And YARA For Linux, etc,....</li>
